        This page remains (somewhat) in the style of my website prior to getting my new laptop.
        The theme of my website has obviously changed since the creation of this page. See <a href='/html/blog/posts/new-laptop.html'>blog post</a>.

            This website is really weird from a technical standpoint.
            Firstly, I have nginx operating as a proxy service for my subdomains.
            I am not going to talk about my subdomains here because they will all probably be utterly self-explanatory, or have their own about section.
            Following this, I have a simple python script running a webserver that serves html documents and other files, as you would expect.
            The weirdness comes from the cursed custom """parser""" and syntax for the html documents.
            Any html documents in the sites files may contain an expression like "$[echo \$\[...]]" where ... is bash code. 
            Upon being requested by a browser, the web server executes each instance of one of these expressions and replaces the expression with the executed expression's output.
            In addition to this, upon being requested, each instance of "{}" in a page is replaced with an arbitrary value provided by the webserver and specified by its index in the list of all "{}"s in the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, I generate static content for the pages (I am unwilling to use javascript because javascript) not through any standard means but through hacky and stupid bash scripts.
            There is not a particular reason for me to do it this way, I was just bored.
            A sort of neat example of this system is the html for the directory index page (like <a href='/files'>here</a>).

                At the moment, this site is running on some dell optiplex 3040 (I think?) I have in my basement. 
                In the future, I would like to get this running on the server that I took from the basement of my school (with permission of an employee who I am pretty sure did not have the authority to allow me to do this, but I'm not complaining).
            </del>
            I have moved this site to the server. See <a href='/html/server-migration.html'>server-migration.html</a>

            This website is designed to look reasonably similar to my laptop:
            <img src='/files/my-laptop.png'/>
            *My laptop no longer looks like this.
