                    Her name is Lavinia, which is a stupid reference probably 2 people who see this website will get.
                    I love her so.

                    My website looks different now. Lavinia has a new colorscheme and thus so does my website.
                    $[img-caption "/files/fw16-new-colorscheme.png" "new colorscheme for my framework"]
                    Now (2024-07-06) it has a different colorscheme:
                    $[img-caption "/files/fw16-new-new-colorscheme.png" "new new colorscheme for my framework"]
                    I'm not going to update the website's colorscheme because I am lazy.<br>
                    as of 2024-07-27, I have made a media query that will use a dark colorscheme matching my laptop should you have a dark browser theme set.
