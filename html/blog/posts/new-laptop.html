            Her name is Lavinia, which is a stupid reference probably 2 people who see this website will get.
            I love her so.

        <p>
            My website looks different now. Lavinia has a new colorscheme and thus so does my website.
            <img src=/files/fw16-new-colorscheme.png alt='new colorscheme for my framework'>
            Now (2024-07-06) it has a different colorscheme:
            <img src=/files/fw16-new-new-colorscheme.png alt='new new colorscheme for my framework'>
            I'm not going to update the website's colorscheme because I am lazy.
