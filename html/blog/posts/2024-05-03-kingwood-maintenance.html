                    My school has a big wide belt sander in the wood shop, it is fancy and has electronic controls and whatnot.
                    There are two contactors that control the movement of the table, one for up, one for down.
                    The contactor to move the table down has failed twice, once due to general lack of maintenance, and once because the person that replaced it the first time damaged the new contactor during the replacement.
                    Luckily, for whatever reason the person that replaced the contactor for whatever reason replaced both the up and down contactor, only one of which was bad. 
                    Because of this there was a spare contactor that was good lying around somewhere in the wood shop, thus I was able to replace the damaged replacement contactor.
