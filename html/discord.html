                As one who is not particularly partial to internet centralization, and seeing as I have had discord accounts get banned for seemingly nothing in the past, I am not particularly fond of using discord.
                Unfortunately, humans that I like speaking to use discord in large enough volumes that it is likely to be rather challenging to convince all of the ones I particularly care about to migrate to some other platform.
                This is not a very nice state of things.
