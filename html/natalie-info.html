                <h2>Timezone (this is currently broken? I don't know why. The correct time is PDT or the other one)</h2>
                its really quite odd, the commands run to generate this section are just date "+%Z (UTC%z)" and date +%T. When I run these in an ssh session, they give expected output, but when the server executes them, it thinks its in UTC. baffling. 
                Timezone I am in: $[date "+%Z (UTC%z)"]<br>
                The local time as of this page being requested was: $[date +%T]

                <h2>Other things</h2>
                I will probably include information about myself that is vaguely identifiable.
                This is a bad idea, but I don't think anyone actually cares about messing with me enough to do anything bad with whatever information is available here.
                I am comically bad at writing about myself, so I will disguise my shortcomings by making a list.
                <ul>
                    <li>I would be a senior if I was going to hichschool. I am not going to highschool because I decided it was bad and that I would be going to college instead.</li>
                    <li>I really like messing with anything technical, be it computers or locks (these interests are at times problematic for my highschool, but oh well).</li>
                    <li>In addition to standard hackery hobbies, I am interested in machining, urban planning, public transportation (especially rail vehicles (insert joke about autism)), and languistics (this one might be covered by "standard hackery hobbies"). I also seem to enjoy overusing parenthesis.</li>
                    <li>The number of people I know who can use my computer is 1 (me). I have <italic>really</italic> weird keybindings and use a nonstandard keyboard layout.</li>
                    <li>I own twelve lenovo thinkpads manufactured between 2010 and 2014.</li>
                    <li><del>My laptop which I use as my main computer is a modified lenovo thinkpad T530 <a href=/html/my-laptop.html>which is pretty neat.</a> </del><a href=/html/blog/posts/new-laptop.html>refer to this</a></li>

                <h2>Vaguely funny things I have done (Don't read this if you are employed by Portland public schools)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nearly gotten suspended for allegedly installing (The IT department genuinely said this) """Cuban malware""" on the school network. This was entirely not grounded in reality, IT is just insane. (<a href='/html/I-dont-like-IT.html'>Minor tangent</a>)</li>
                    <li>Gotten suspended for exactly one day for posting the school district's wifi password on discord (stupid, but I was bored. Also, IT was mean to me, see tangent linked above.)</li>

                <h2>Music I listen to (you should too)</h2>
                I am going to use this as a means by which I can impose music recommendations upon whoever reads this page.
                According to a hacky script I wrote that tracks what songs I listen to with mpd, here are artists I like:<br>
