                    words are not a thing I am good at. this is exacerbaited when the words are about myself.
                    despite this, I shall attempt a suitable description of myself.
                </p>
                <br>
                ideally, I am to be referred to as an "it" or a "she". the former is preferred to some degree.<br>
                timezone I am in: $[date "+%Z (UTC%z)"].<br>
                age: $[echo $(( $(date +%s) - $(date -d "2007-04-01" +%s) ))] seconds. that is $[echo "scale=8; ($(date +%s) - $(date -d '2007-04-01' +%s)) / (365.25*24*3600)" | bc] [earth] years.<br>
                I am kind of a college student. it is complicated. I will be a college student with less complications by fall of 2025.<br>
                I like systems. particularly ones that have reasonably consistent behavior based on a set of rules. this is omnipresent in my interests.

                    <li>train tracks</li>
                </ul>
