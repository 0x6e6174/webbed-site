<h2>documentation is meant to be read</h2>
do not make it harder for this one, or anyone else to read. if you do, it will hate you forever.

do not make anyone ever join a discord server to read documentation.
if you can write a message about a problem in discord and pin it, you can copy that information in to a markdown document and push it to git.
it does not want to join your discord server. it does not want to join your matrix room. it does not want to join your arcane and non-publicly-indexed forum of any kind.
it wants to fix the issue it is having.
<br><br>
it is perfectly willing to join community forums in cases where it is interested in the project. this is not the issue.
the issue is someone arbitrarily deciding that&mdash;instead of simply providing one with the relevant information&mdash;that one must first solve some poorly constructed riddle made out of group invite links and login portals first, at no benefit to literally anyone.
<br><br>
it cannot understand the thought process that leads to doing this.
unfortunately, it seems to be a common one, as this one has encountered many instances of this.
it cannot fathom how utterly muffin-brained someone must be to write documentation on how to solve an issue and then deliberately obfuscate said documentation.
this makes it more annoyed than scientific articles being paywalled, because it can't even blame the capitalist greed. 
publish documentation or don't write it in the first place.$[make-footnote "the particular instance pictured made it annoyed enough to write a \"thought\" for the first time in months."]
