        <h2>this is my favorite shirt!</h2>
        <p>it is so good! and my friend made it!</p>
        <p>it is purported to be made with a cnc vinyl cutter and a heat press.</p>

            I very much enjoy the talgo 8 trainsets that are operated by amtrak here. 
            I find the shared bogie design of the cars to be interesting.
            I greatly enjoy the fact that I have fake talgo merchandise now.
            this friend and I rode this model of train to seattle somewhat recently, it was much nicer than the other amtrak rolling stock, which we rode on our return journey.
