        <h2>this is its favorite shirt!</h2>
        <p>it is so good! and its friend made it!</p>
        <p>it is purported to be made with a cnc vinyl cutter and a heat press.</p>
        <p>
            it very much enjoys the talgo 8 trainsets that are operated by amtrak here. 
            it finds the shared bogie design of the cars to be interesting.
            it greatly enjoys the fact that it has fake talgo merchandise now.
            this friend and natalie rode this model of train to seattle somewhat recently, it was much nicer than the other amtrak rolling stock, which the two of us rode on our return journey.
