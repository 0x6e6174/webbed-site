<!-- TITLE: This website has a lot of technical debt and I should rewrite it -->

This is horrible and bad. The html of just about every webpage is utter garbage because I am me. 
Rewriting everything is going to be such a task, a task that I really should do. 
<br><br>
Woo!
<br><br>
I should really unbodge the css at some point, too. Also, I need to remember to add a license and probably also a footer at some point.
<br><br>
I have at the very least fixed some of the horrendous practices seen on this website by the implementation of nginx as a proxy service.
Now, when not having a valid ssl cert (for a good reason, this will be fixed when there ceases to be a good reason) breaks my webserver (for some reason), not everything breaks!
hooray.
<br><br>
I need to stop using an iframe for these, this page was designed prior to caving to my friends demand that I make my website "have" "consistent styling" and also "not use the whole page width for text," 
thus it used to be that these posts would take up the entire body width, but now there are just two margins.
<br><br>
I should probably update site-info.html now.
