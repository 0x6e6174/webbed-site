<!-- TITLE: why are phones so bad? -->

in its experience, there are 0 phones that do not break every 2-4 months.
this is stupid because society made the baffling and frankly quite bad near unilateral decision that phones would be largely required to be a functional being.
<hr>
natalie used to have an iphone SE 1st gen (a1662).
this phone was awful by virtue of being a phone, but it worked.
unfortunately, phones are garbage, so this one probably spent $160 on screen replacements for it$[make-footnote 'how on earth can phones not survive being in a pocket? this is very easy'] because the screen would break every 2-4 months.
also, its home button, both cameras, and speakers all ceased to function and were accordingly removed.
<br><br>
eventually, its father gave it his old phone. this was a samsung galaxy s10e.
this phone managed to be worse than the iphone SE 1st gen a1662. 
why on earth would anything design a phone the screen of which protrudes past the body of the phone such that if one dares to even observe it, the screen breaks?
this is like if they asked an engineer to design a phone and then did the exact opposite. 
also, the corners were rounded.
not the corners of the case (though those were too), but the corners of the actual screen. 
why on earth would one ever do this?
<blockquote>hello, LCD manufacturer? we would like a more expensive and worse screen please.</blockquote>
nonsense.
<br><br>
anyways, the s10e stopped charging and gives an overheat warning 80% of the time that natalie tries to turn it on (just being plugged in to usb-c).
it got this phone in july, so that is within the predicted range of 2-4 months.

why are phones like this?
it wants to not own a phone but they are so necessary.
it really is not sure why people need to be able to {text,call} it.
if one wants to communicate with it, they can send it an email. 
this is not a difficult concept, and yet it still regularly receives text messages and phone calls.
