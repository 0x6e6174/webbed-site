while natalie was making $[make-link /stats/what-song-is-it-listening-to], specifically while it was writing the service that would send song updates to the server from its laptop, it decided to make mpd started by its init system (openrc).
this quickly devolved in to also making pipewire start from its init system. prior to now, it was start by an init script ran by the compositor natalie uses, which would run <code>unfuck audio</code>. for some reason, likely due to the fact that natalie uses seatd instead of elogind for session management on its primary laptop, the default artix init scripts for all pipewire related services and mpd did not work. 
it spent around two hours hacking on these, and now have arrived at a system which vaguely works. both mpd and {pipewire,pipewire-pulse,wireplumber} are started by init, however, for some reason which is entirely obscure to it, pipewire does not recognize anything other than its bluetooth headphones.
this doesn't actually matter, because natalie functionally never use the speakers in its laptop, but such an issue is still quite stupid.
