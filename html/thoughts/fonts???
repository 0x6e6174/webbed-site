I am unsure as to what is going on?<br>
on $[make-link /html/natalie-sightings.html], the font never loads. I have failed to ascertain why it is that this occurs, as this has only become an issue today and no edits have been made to that page remotely recently. What on earth.<br><br>

I have an unfortunate habit of accruing computer ghosts that break things in horribly unclear ways.
