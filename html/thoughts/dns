odette, one of natalie's meat friends (not computer friends) (though she is a computery friend) just <a href='https://puppygirl.systems'>bought a domain</a>. apparently the registrar she bought it from didn't have an api, which was problematic because she does not have a static ip.
because natalie is a reasonable being, it decided to start hosting dns for her. now it knows (some) things about dns!
it likes learning things.

as stated in the changelog, should any random website tourist wish to use its dns setup for one's website (natalie does not recommend this, nor does it know why you would want to do this.) you can email it. it might even respond.
