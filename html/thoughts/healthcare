<h2>How is it this bad?</h2>

<h3>endocrinological</h3>
I take estrogen (tablets, 2mg, 3/day), spironolactone (tablets, 50mg, 2/day), and progesterone (gel capsuls, 100mg, 1/day) because I am transgender.
here are the associated costs for the above medications:
<ul>
    <li>estrogen: $14.05/month, $168.6/year</li>
    <li>spironolactone: $6/month, $72/year</li>
    <li>progesterone: $15/month, $180/year</li>
    <li>total: $420.6/year</li>
</ul>
you will note that estrogen and an anti androgen are responsible for 57.2% of the yearly cost.
this is ridiculous.<br>
I did some calculations:<br>
cost of diy estrogen injectable solution (estradiol enanthate, 40mg/ml, 10ml): $70-$100<br>
necessary doseage for estrogen monotherapy: ~.13ml<br>
injection timing: every 7 days<br>
10ml/.13ml = 74.9 weeks of estrogen<br>
52 weeks in a year.<br>
100*1/(10/.13/52) = $67.6/year for estrogen (upper bound)<br>
70*1/(10/.13/52) = $47.32/year for estrogen (lower bound)<br>
<br>
why is diy cheaper than having healthcare?
this does not account for cost of needles and alcohol wipes, but that is negligible.

<h3>neurological</h3>
the psychologist that did my autism evaluation thinks that I am depressed. 
this is based on 0 evidence other than my consistently high score on the PHQ-9. 
I contend that the PHQ-9 is not a useful tool of assessment for neurodivergent people.
<br><br>
apparently, it is somehow more conceiveable that I am autistic and depressed than it is that I could be autistic and have adhd.
I am very clearly not depressed, in fact, I would say that other than the negative impacts of the very obvious and DSM-V compliant signs of ADHD I exhibit, I am doing quite well.
