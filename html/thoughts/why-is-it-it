why is it it?
</blockquote>
it is asked something vaguely similar to this with notable enough frequency to justify writing an explanation that it can link to for all future instances of such a query.
it is it for about 3 reasons:
<ol>
  <li>it thinks the grammatical implications of not using first or second perspective pronouns are neat</li>
  <li>it would rather be an object than a person</li>
  <li>its internal monologue is just sort of like that. this makes speaking "normally" annoying because it needs to pass internal thoughts through a translation layer to speak "normally" (with standard perspective pronouns). it thought this was how most things thought. recently it was informed that most things do not think that way. following this, it decided to give up on translating its internal monologue to first or second perspective.$[make-footnote 'when referring to others, must the reader consult their internal lookup table that maps entities to pronouns? it has been told that this is also an irregular means of thinking.']</li>
</ol>
