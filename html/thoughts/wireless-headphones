it is writing this at 12am on a termux session on its phone, on a bus home from its friend's house. that is neat.
<br>
<br>
its current headphones, and all the wireless ones it has ever had have used what can only be described as the worst firmware. why is this? how is it possible that there are 0 headphone firmware engineers that are competent? it does not understand.
<br>
<br>
its headphones:<ul>
<li>repeat "disconnected" infinitely at random intervals when disconnected from a device, or just when they feel like it. they do not cease unless power cycled.</li>
<li>always report a charge of 80% over bluetooth.</li>
<li>inconsistently announce low batteries. there have been exactly three instances in which they have given a low battery warning prior to powering off</li>
</ul>
sorry if formatting bad. phone.
