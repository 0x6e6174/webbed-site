<h2>it is annoyed by this medium</h2>
<hr>
this medium presents thoughts in a 1 dimensional manor without an ergonomic way to link between different posts. 
this annoys it because it generally tends to think of information such that each concept is a node and each relationship between concepts is an edge between those nodes on a two dimensional graph. 
the format of this webpage does not allow for such structure due to the linearity.
<hr>
perhaps a "digital garden" or similar system would be a better means of managing this page.

<h3>issues with implementing a digital garden style approach to a webpage like this one</h3>
natalie is allergic to organizational tools. 
unfortunately, if it were to make a digital garden, it would probably write software to generate pages based on norg,$[make-footnote "natalie is only diagnosed with level 1 ASD and thus it does not have a build compliant with using emacs (requires ASD level 2+). also, neovim is already well integrated in to the way it does things."] which counts as an organizational tool.
<br>
why is it bad at organizational tools?
<br>
it assumes this is due to its marginally above average ability to remember information.
<br>
can this be mitigated by being very stuborn in its useage of such a tool?
<br>
maybe.
<hr>
making software that integrates with the way that this website already runs would be rather annoying due to the nest of complexity natalie has built up.
it supposes that it could have software similar to htmlgen that writes norg documents converted to html to natalieee.net/garden or something. 
it could have even more symlinks floating around directories associated with this website, which would be kind of funny. 
<hr>
another option would be to simply run a garden on a subdomain.
something like garden.natalieee.net would work, though then it must either retool its current webserver to be less horribly tied to this one specific project,$[make-footnote "thing it should do anyways"] or write an entirely different webserver.$[make-footnote "it starts college on monday, it should not do this"]
<hr>
another issue with doing such a thing is figuring out a reasonable schema for nodes in the graph.
it is sure there are things that are more intelligent than it that have thought about such issues before, but it thinks it would probably be more interesting to create its own.
it supposes it could keep everything in a flat directory. this seems silly, however it doubts its future predicting abilities when it comes to what categories it should put things in.
<hr>
implementing a digital garden seems as though it would probably demand redoing the whole website, actually. 
it has already done that three to six times (depending on how one counts), and is not particularly keen on doing so again.
<br><br>
oh well, it shall consider alternatives for the structure of this webpage.
