<h2>I am annoyed by this medium</h2>
<hr>
this medium presents thoughts in a 1 dimensional manor without an ergonomic way to link between different posts. 
this annoys me because I generally tend to think of information such that each concept is a node and each relationship between concepts is an edge between those nodes on a two dimensional graph. 
the format of this webpage does not allow for such structure due to the linearity.
<hr>
perhaps a "digital garden" or similar system would be a better means of managing this page.

<h3>issues with implementing a digital garden style approach to a webpage like this one</h3>
I am allergic to organizational tools. 
unfortunately, if I were to make a digital garden, I would probably write software to generate pages based on norg,$[make-footnote "I am only diagnosed with level 1 ASD and thus do not have a build compliant with using emacs (requires ASD level 2+). also, neovim is already well integrated in to the things that I do."] which counts as an organizational tool.
<br>
why am I bad at organizational tools?
<br>
I assume this is due to my marginally above average ability to remember information.
<br>
can this be mitigated by being very stuborn in my useage of such a tool?
<br>
maybe.
<hr>
making software that integrates with the way that this website already runs would be rather annoying due to the nest of complexity I have built up.
I suppose that I could have software similar to htmlgen that writes norg documents converted to html to natalieee.net/garden or something. 
I could have even more symlinks floating around directories associated with this website, which would be kind of funny. 
<hr>
another option would be to simply run a garden on a subdomain.
something like garden.natalieee.net would work, though then I must either retool my current webserver to be less horribly tied to this one specific project,$[make-footnote "thing I should do anyways"] or write an entirely different webserver.$[make-footnote "I start college on monday, I should not do this"]
<hr>
another issue with doing such a thing is figuring out a reasonable schema for nodes in the graph.
I am sure there are people who are more intelligent than me who have thought about such issues before, but I think it will probably be more interesting to create my own.
I suppose I could keep everything in a flat directory. this seems silly, however I doubt my future predicting abilities when it comes to what categories I should put things in.
<hr>
implementing a digital garden seems as though it would probably demand redoing the whole website, actually. 
I have already done that three to six times (depending on how one counts), and am not particularly keen on doing so again.
<br><br>
oh well, I shall consider alternatives for the structure of this webpage.
