This post is confusing and might be a marginally abnormal quine. in html*. Have fun.<br>
This is a thing that works now. 
The format in which I can write these posts as well as how they work is reasonably interesting. 
I am most displeased due to my inability to figure out a reasonable means of having iframes such that their height is that of their respective content.
below you will find the code for this web page. it is interesting, especially if you haven't read <a href=/html/site-info.html> the site info page</a>.
<pre><xmp>$[cat ./html/random-thoughts.html]</xmp></pre>
<br>
you may ask: natalie[ee], why are you using iframes?<br>
the answer to such a question would of course be "by using iframes, I may make a post contain bash commands as detailed on <a href=/html/site-info.html> the site info page</a> while also being arbitrarily invalid html. Plain text would make a valid thought post.
<br>
an example of such, this post:
<pre>$[cat ./html/thoughts/this-is-a-thought | sed 's/&/\&amp;/g; s/</\&lt;/g; s/>/\&gt;/g']</pre>
As can be observed, the title is set via a rather kludgy comment in the post file. This allows for filenames that differ from titles, which I implemented for no particular reason.
