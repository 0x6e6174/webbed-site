<!-- TITLE: there is less technical debt now. -->

<p>I modified almost every html file in the site. there are less problems now. </p>

<p>thoughts like these are no longer viewed as iframes, images are now handled by my img-caption script:
<pre><xmp>
$[cat ./scripts/img-caption]
</xmp></pre>

Have I mentioned how much I love that a significant portion of the content on this site is generated by bash script?<br><br>
The above file is included here with <code>$\[echo $\[cat ./scripts/img-caption]]</code>. I greatly enjoy this.
</p>

<p>Given that the css that is included in every site has now been standardized, I should probably start generalizing the start of each html document such that I can change one file to update the head section of all documents.
Also, I should implement a header.</p>

<p>Over the past 3 days, I have increased the number of entries in the changelog by approximately 1.8 times. I am amused by this.</p>
