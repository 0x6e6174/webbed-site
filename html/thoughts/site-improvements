<!-- TITLE: re: last thought; changes have been implemented -->
this site now uses <a href='https://git.natalieee.net/nat/htmlgen'>htmlgen</a> to generate html from common lisp and bash commands at compile time.
this has massively improved loading times on nearly all pages by cutting the number of bash commands that need to be used.

overall, this is a very significant performance improvement. now, it needs to update site-info again.<br>
unfortunately, it broke its blog. maybe it will fix it at some point.<br>
todo: edit html/blog/index.html to state this 
<hr>
here is an amusing video of the code for this web page being broken during the migration to this system.
natalie did not actually fix this, it only removed the problematic code from the first post here.<br>
