much to natalie's detriment, this server runs debian.
<br><br>
such circumstances would most likely be acceptable if its computers were not cursed with not working in hard to explain ways.<br>
issues it has with debian:
<ul>
    <li>the package manager does not work.</li>
    <li>it cannot install a modern python version without jumping through at least 12 very small and inconvienently located hoops.</li>
    <li>it has to use nix as a package manager to reasonably do anything.</li>
    <li>it has to interact with systemd without a layer of abstraction</li>
</ul>
<br>
it really needs to migrate to nixos for its server.
normally, such an idea as installing nixos would seem abhorrent to it, however nixos actually seems extremely reasonable for servers.
it does not understand how it is that people can run nixos on a computer that they use outside of a server application. ridiculous.
