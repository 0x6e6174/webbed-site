this concept simply does not make sense to me.
<br><br>
I understand the idea of wanting humans that you are close to. this makes perfect sense to me.<br>
what is the difference between a friend you are close with and a romantic partner? I do not understand.<br>
I do not think I have ever genuinely experienced romantic attraction. I have been informed that this is irregular.
perhaps I am aromantic (note: requires further investigation, alternative explanation: extremely autistic).
I suppose I am functionally in more or less two(?) qprs. this is ideal and I do not understand why such a state is not more common.
<br><br>
what is the point of a romantic relationship when I can have human exposure quotas met simply by having friends?
I must be missing something.
<br><br>
being abnormally close with my friends has the rather amusing consequence of people asking of an arbitrary friend of mine and myself are dating.
I am not entirely sure why this occures. 
I understand if someone makes such an inquiry after observing a friend and I performing an action typically associated with romantic relationships, such as holding hands, however sometimes people ask with no clear reason. baffling.
here is the count for how many times this has happened with all of my friends:
<ul>
    <li>cecilie: 20</li>
    <li>odette: 13</li>
    <li>albert: 1</li>
</ul>
recently, cecilie was happy about the 20th increment to this count because it means that the interlocking metal hearts with notches for each time someone has asked this question that it made me (with a forge and anvil! very cool) would have both a decimal and the same number of notches on each heart.
the indicator shall be pictured below, because I think it is very cool.
